### Creating an online attendance “system”

In the beginning, I was only asked to make routine student attendance recaps whose output was easy-to-read data.
However, I was too lazy to repeat the same work over and over again. Why not just make it automated? From here I started learning data management in Sheets and Forms. From here my first hands-on with the very intimidating regex.

### Implementing bulk export to PDF

Printing student report cards one by one is a job that is usually done at the end of each semester. However, it's a different story during a pandemic. Everything is done from home. Helping the printing process is not possible to do perfectly.

From here I came up with a solution: use the apps script extension that is already in Sheets. At that time, the JavaScript code was intimidating enough for me. I found suitable code to copy paste with a few tweaks from Stack Overflow. And, yes, it worked in the end despite didn't have good-understanding of it.

### Managing admission data

Before our school got a vendor to build a school management application, I was responsible for managing PPDB data, starting from form data, test data, test scheduling, to the automation of sending WhatsApp messages to all participants. Luckily, I managed to get through all of this just armed with googling.

### What did I learn

In the end I realized that on-demand learning process is fun! I might not be familiar with apps scripts, regex, etc. without those “hard” demand.
