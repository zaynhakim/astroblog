[GitHub repo](https://github.com/zaynhakim/astroblog)

This blog is built with [Astro](https://astro.build) and deployed on [Netlify](https://netlify.com).

I started building of this blog in November last year. Initially, this blog is my continuation of learning [Remix](https://remix.run) after being postponed due to IDCamp - Dicoding program. I was encountered several problems when deploying it to [fly.io](https://fly.io). Later I tried to rebuild this blog on Astro.

I still excited to learn Remix, especially how to deploy it directly on the edge via Cloudflare pages and workers later.
