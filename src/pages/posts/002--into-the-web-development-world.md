If You ask me when was I starting play around with web programming languages, I would like to answer: since I had a Friendster account!

For those who ever have a Friendster page (Lol, You may guess my age from here), it's cool to have a cool Friendster profile page. Embedding music, weird cursor, or blinking text is as cool as creating a JJ in TikTok or Instagram nowadays.

### Blogger: Tried to be a content creator

Becoming a blogger with well-performing AdSense is one of my target years ago. But, later I realized that being a consistent content creator without proper knowledge is not enjoyable for me. So I decided to not continuing this attempt. However, making a cool blog layout is interesting but hard without good understanding of web langs.

### Watching Web Programming UNPAS YouTube Channel

This is one of helpful learning sources for me in understanding web programming languages. After practicing learning materials from this channel, I attempted to build a PHP based web app with Laravel framework. Since I was a beginner and lack of familiarity, I still struggling to build the app.

Another problem for me is, although Laravel has a pretty straight forward APIs, I still need to switch the context to my poor understanding of JavaScript in the front-end side.

### Start practicing basics in Freecodecamp

Besides Laravel, I tried to learn other web frameworks to accomplish my goal: Creating a simple attendance system app. From Django, Flutter, to Redwood JS. From there I realized that I can't do more without familiarity with basics of those languages. I dropped Django and Flutter for their longer learning curves, so now I can't avoid JavaScript!

To be more familiar with HTML, CSS and JavaScript, I finished some tutorials there, but without exams for certifications because again, lack of familiarity. Moreover, I didn't think that I need those certificates. My main goals was building a working app.

### Looking into JavaScript ecosystem

Although it was common to give some interactivity in a page with jQuery, my first reaction to it is, oh no, it is messy. Moreover, some random people on internet suggested to use more modern tools like React or Vue. I tried both of them, and again, my take is, web development is quite difficult and frustrating.

I looked for some good example codes of both React and Vue on Github, but more struggles were incoming: Those all were written in TypeScript!

### Practicing Next.js starter tutorial

Next.js beginner tutorial is pretty straights forward. I can follow it easily while I still struggling to understand TypeScript-based codes.

At this point I feel that coding web page is not as scary as directly building React or Vue app. Thanks to its simplicity, I succeeded deploying a Next.js web page for the first time.

### Trying Remix starter tutorial

My first impression was like I'm building a new Laravel app but without context switching needed. This is interesting! After practicing Remix Jokes tutorial, I tried to build a simple attendance taking app as it was my need at that time.

### Joining IDCamp - Dicoding React course

Later I postponed this project because I just heard a new IDCamp - Dicoding 2022 just started. I don't want to miss this opportunity to upskilling myself. This project is postponed until now and luckily, our school just building a whole academic system with a vendor.
