[GitHub repo](https://github.com/zaynhakim/astroblog)

This blog is built with [Astro](https://astro.build) and deployed on [Netlify](https://netlify.com).

I started building of this blog in November last year. Initially, this blog is my continuation of learning [Remix](https://remix.run) after being postponed due to IDCamp - Dicoding program. Later I rebuilt this blog with Astro.
